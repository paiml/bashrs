## Running Examples

### In Browser

```html
<script type="module">
    import init, { execute_script } from './pkg/bashrs.js';

    await init();

    // Fetch and execute example
    const response = await fetch('./scripts/01-hello-world.sh');
    const script = await response.text();
    const result = execute_script(script);

    console.log(result.stdout);
</script>
```

### In Node.js

```javascript
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import init, { execute_script } from './pkg/bashrs.js';

await init();

const script = readFileSync('./scripts/01-hello-world.sh', 'utf-8');
const result = execute_script(script);

console.log(result.stdout);
```

### Using the Demo

1. Open `http://localhost:8001/runtime-demo.html`
2. Load an example using the example buttons
3. Or paste script content into the editor
4. Click "Execute Script"

---

## Testing Examples

All examples are tested to ensure they work correctly:

```bash
# Run example tests
cd rash
cargo test --features wasm wasm::executor::tests
```

---

## Creating Your Own

### Template

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Example N: [Title]
# [Description]

# Your script here
echo "Hello from my script!"
```

### Best Practices

1. **Add comments** - Explain what your script does
2. **Use variables** - Make scripts configurable
3. **Echo progress** - Show what's happening
4. **Keep it simple** - Remember current limitations

### Current Limitations

See [RUNTIME-USAGE.md](../RUNTIME-USAGE.md#limitations) for full list.

**Not supported yet:**
- Pipes (`|`)
- Redirects (`>`, `<`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `case`)
- Functions
- External commands (`ls`, `grep`, etc.)
