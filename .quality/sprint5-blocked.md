# SPRINT 5 - BLOCKED ⚠️

**Focus**: Code Coverage Measurement
**Status**: **BLOCKED** - cargo-llvm-cov tooling issue
**Duration**: 2 hours investigation
**Results**: Blocker identified, work suspended

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 5 attempted to establish code coverage measurement infrastructure following ROADMAP requirements (>85% coverage target). Investigation revealed a critical blocker with `cargo-llvm-cov` where no `.profraw` files are generated despite tests running successfully.

---

## Work Completed

### ✅ Research & Analysis
1. **Researched top Rust projects** (tokio, ripgrep, actix-web, alacritty)
   - Finding: Most use cargo-llvm-cov with nextest
   - Finding: Both inline tests and integration tests are acceptable
   - Finding: Many projects don't publish coverage metrics but maintain high quality

2. **Identified correct coverage pattern**:
   ```bash
   # Two-phase approach (production pattern)
   cargo llvm-cov --no-report nextest
   cargo llvm-cov report --lcov --output-path lcov.info
   ```

3. **Updated COVERAGE.md** with correct two-phase pattern from actix-web

4. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - ✅ Installed cargo-nextest 0.9.104
   - ✅ Installed cargo-llvm-cov 0.6.19
   - ✅ Added llvm-tools-preview component
   - ✅ Created Makefile with coverage targets
   - ✅ Added [profile.test] to Cargo.toml with `incremental = false`

## Blocker Details

### Problem Statement
`cargo llvm-cov` fails with:
```
warning: not found *.profraw files in /home/noah/src/rash/target/llvm-cov-target
error: no input files specified. See llvm-profdata merge -help
```

### Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)

**Why #1**: Why are no .profraw files generated?
→ Tests run successfully (495 passed) but produce no coverage data

**Why #2**: Why don't tests produce coverage data?
→ Binaries are not instrumented with `-C instrument-coverage`

**Why #3**: Why aren't binaries instrumented?
→ cargo-llvm-cov is reusing cached binaries: `Finished test profile in 0.07s`

**Why #4**: Why is it using cached binaries?
→ cargo-llvm-cov is not forcing a rebuild with instrumentation flags

**Why #5 (ROOT CAUSE)**: Why isn't cargo-llvm-cov instrumenting?
→ **Unknown - Suspected bug in cargo-llvm-cov 0.6.19 or environment issue**

### Evidence
```bash
# Tests run successfully
cargo llvm-cov --no-report nextest --lib
Summary [32.933s] 495 tests run: 495 passed, 3 skipped

# But no profraw files exist
find . -name "*.profraw"
# 0 files found

# Build uses cached artifacts
Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.07s
```

### Attempted Workarounds (All Failed)
1. ❌ Two-phase collection (`--no-report` + `report`)
2. ❌ Added `incremental = false` to [profile.test]
3. ❌ Used `--ignore-filename-regex` flag
4. ❌ Forced clean rebuild (`rm -rf target/llvm-cov-target`)
5. ❌ Custom CARGO_TARGET_DIR
6. ❌ Different cargo-llvm-cov versions (0.6.13, 0.6.19)
7. ❌ Both nightly and stable toolchains
8. ❌ Manual RUSTFLAGS="-C instrument-coverage"

---

## System Environment

```
Rust: 1.90.0 stable (also tried 1.92.0-nightly)
cargo-llvm-cov: 0.6.19
cargo-nextest: 0.9.104
llvm-tools-preview: installed
OS: Linux 6.8.0-83-generic
Platform: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

---

## Impact Assessment

### Blocked Work
- ❌ Coverage baseline measurement
- ❌ Coverage reports for CI/CD
- ❌ Coverage threshold enforcement
- ❌ Sprint 0 quality gate: >85% coverage requirement

### Not Blocked
- ✅ All 495 tests still passing (100% pass rate maintained)
- ✅ Can proceed with other quality gates (performance, features)
- ✅ Test quality is high (11 idempotence, 11 unicode, 27 adversarial, 24 ShellCheck)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Proceed to Sprint 6 (Performance Optimization)** - Not dependent on coverage
2. **File issue with cargo-llvm-cov** - Provide reproduction case
3. **Try alternative**: Test with a minimal reproduction project

### Future Resolution Options

**Option 1: Debug cargo-llvm-cov** (Est: 2-4 hours)
- Create minimal reproduction case
- File GitHub issue with cargo-llvm-cov
- Try older Rust versions (1.80.0, 1.75.0)

**Option 2: Manual LLVM instrumentation** (Est: 4-6 hours)
- Use RUSTFLAGS directly without cargo-llvm-cov wrapper
- Manual llvm-profdata merge
- Manual llvm-cov report generation

**Option 3: Alternative tools** (Not recommended per user)
- User specified: "we only use LLVM"
- Tarpaulin not an option
- grcov requires manual setup

**Option 4: Defer coverage** (Recommended short-term)
- Focus on other quality metrics
- Return to coverage after Sprint 6-7
- Coverage is valuable but not blocking for correctness

## Files Modified

```
Created:
- .quality/sprint5-blocked.md (this file)
- rash/Makefile (coverage targets)
- docs/specifications/COVERAGE.md (updated with two-phase pattern)

Modified:
- Cargo.toml (added [profile.test] with incremental=false)
```

## Toyota Way Principles Applied

### 反省 (Hansei) - Reflection
- ✅ Recognized blocker and stopped rather than continuing with workarounds
- ✅ Conducted Five Whys root cause analysis
- ✅ Documented thoroughly for future resolution

### 現地現物 (Genchi Genbutsu) - Direct Observation
- ✅ Researched actual production Rust projects (tokio, actix-web)
- ✅ Examined binary artifacts to verify instrumentation
- ✅ Checked actual .profraw file generation

### 自働化 (Jidoka) - Build Quality In
- ✅ Infrastructure ready for when blocker is resolved
- ✅ Makefile targets prepared: `make coverage`
- ✅ Documentation complete for future use

---

## Next Steps

**Sprint 6: Performance Optimization** (ROADMAP line 586)
- Establish criterion benchmarks
- Target: <10ms simple transpilation, <100ms complex
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Memory usage analysis

Coverage work will resume after resolving cargo-llvm-cov issue or after Sprint 6-7 completion.

---

## Quality Score

**Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐ 3/5 - Blocked but well-analyzed

- ✅ Thorough investigation (2 hours)
- ✅ Correct approach identified (two-phase pattern)
- ✅ Infrastructure prepared for future use
- ❌ Blocker not resolved
- ❌ Coverage baseline not established

**Velocity**: 🔴 Blocked - No coverage metrics obtained
**Methodology**: 📚 Toyota Way applied correctly
**Quality**: ⚠️ Blocker prevents completion

---

🔴 **SPRINT 5 STATUS: BLOCKED - Moving to Sprint 6** 🔴

Coverage work deferred until cargo-llvm-cov issue resolved.
