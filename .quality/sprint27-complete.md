## Function Documentation

Each of the 7 new functions is documented with:

✅ **Function signature** (Rust type annotations)
✅ **Code example** (working Rust code)
✅ **Shell implementation** (POSIX-compliant)
✅ **Safety/semantics notes** (behavior guarantees)

### String Functions Documented

1. **`string_replace(s, old, new)`**
   - Example: Replace "world" with "rust"
   - Implementation: POSIX parameter expansion
   - Properties: first occurrence only, case sensitive

2. **`string_to_upper(s)`**
   - Example: Convert "alice" to "ALICE"
   - Implementation: `tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'`
   - Properties: idempotent, POSIX-compliant

3. **`string_to_lower(s)`**
   - Example: Normalize OS detection
   - Implementation: `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`
   - Properties: idempotent, POSIX-compliant

### File System Functions Documented

4. **`fs_copy(src, dst)`**
   - Example: Deploy configuration file
   - Safety: Source validation before copy
   - Error handling: Stderr output on failures

5. **`fs_remove(path)`**
   - Example: Remove lock file
   - Safety: Path validation before removal
   - Error handling: Stderr output on failures

6. **`fs_is_file(path)`**
   - Example: Check system file exists
   - Semantics: POSIX `test -f`
   - Behavior: Returns false for directories/symlinks

7. **`fs_is_dir(path)`**
   - Example: Validate /tmp exists
   - Semantics: POSIX `test -d`
   - Behavior: Returns false for files/symlinks

---

## Real-World Example

Added complete 35-line bootstrap script demonstrating:

✅ **OS detection** using `string_to_lower()` and `string_contains()`
✅ **Platform-specific config** with conditional logic
✅ **File deployment** using `fs_is_file()`, `fs_is_dir()`, `fs_copy()`
✅ **Cleanup operations** using `fs_is_file()` and `fs_remove()`
✅ **Error handling** with proper stderr output and exit codes

The example shows how all new functions work together in a realistic scenario.

## Quality Metrics Table

Included comparison table showing improvements from v0.9.2 to v0.9.3:

| Metric | v0.9.2 | v0.9.3 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total Tests | 603 | 612 | +9 |
| Property Tests | 52 | 60 | +8 |
| Property Cases | ~26k | ~34k | +8k |
| Stdlib Functions | 6 | 13 | +7 |
| Pass Rate | 100% | 100% | ✓ |
| Code Complexity | <10 | <5 avg | ✓ |

This gives users clear visibility into quality improvements.

## Process

1. **00:00** - Attempted to create new release (tag already existed)
2. **00:02** - Verified existing release created by github-actions bot
3. **00:03** - Prepared comprehensive release notes (200+ lines)
4. **00:05** - Updated release using `gh release edit v0.9.3`
5. **00:10** - Verified release published successfully
6. **00:12** - Validated all documentation links
7. **00:15** - Created completion report

**Total Time**: 15 minutes from start to completion

---

## User Impact

### Before Sprint 27
- v0.9.3 release existed on GitHub
- Release notes: minimal (auto-generated changelog link only)
- No function documentation in release
- Users had to search docs for feature details

### After Sprint 27
- Comprehensive release notes with 200+ lines
- All 7 functions documented with examples
- Real-world bootstrap script example
- Quality metrics comparison table
- Complete documentation links
- Clear upgrade path from v0.9.2

### User Experience Improvement

**Before**:
```
User sees: "Full Changelog: v0.9.2...v0.9.3"
User action: Must click through to CHANGELOG to understand changes
```

**After**:
```
User sees: Complete function docs, examples, quality metrics
User action: Can immediately understand and use new features
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

3. **Real-World Example**: 35-line bootstrap script shows practical usage
4. **Quality Metrics**: Comparison table clearly shows improvements
5. **gh CLI**: `gh release edit` made updating existing release trivial

### What Could Improve

1. **Automated Generation**: Could script release notes from CHANGELOG.md
2. **Screenshots**: Could add visual examples of generated shell scripts
3. **Video Walkthrough**: Could create demo video for new functions
4. **Binary Assets**: Could attach pre-compiled binaries for direct download
