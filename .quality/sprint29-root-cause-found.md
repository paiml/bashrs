# Sprint 29 - Root Cause Analysis: Why Tests Failed

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Discovery:** Tests based on incorrect assumptions about code behavior

---

## The Problem

**Observation**: 35+ mutants tested, ALL MISSED (0% kill rate)

**Question**: Why did tests I wrote not kill any mutants?

**Answer**: **Tests assumed functions validated things they don't actually validate.**

---

## Root Cause: Pattern::validate Example

### What I Assumed

```rust
// I assumed Pattern::validate checks string literals for null characters
impl Pattern {
    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<(), String> {
        match self {
            Pattern::Literal(Literal::Str(s)) => {
                if s.contains('\0') {
                    return Err("Null characters not allowed");
                }
                Ok(())
            }
            // ... other patterns
        }
    }
}
```

### What Code Actually Does

```rust
// ACTUAL CODE (line 527-541)
impl Pattern {
    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<(), String> {
        match self {
            Pattern::Literal(_) | Pattern::Variable(_) | Pattern::Wildcard => Ok(()),
            //                 ↑ Accepts ALL literals without checking!
            Pattern::Tuple(patterns) => {
                for pattern in patterns {
                    pattern.validate()?;
                }
                Ok(())
            }
            Pattern::Struct { fields, .. } => {
                for (_, pattern) in fields {
                    pattern.validate()?;
                }
                Ok(())
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Reality**: Pattern::validate does NOT check literal contents. It just returns Ok(()) for all literals.

---

## Why My Test Failed

### My Test

```rust
#[test]
fn test_pattern_validate_rejects_invalid_literal() {
    let invalid_pattern = Pattern::Literal(Literal::Str("\0invalid".to_string()));
    let result = invalid_pattern.validate();
    assert!(result.is_err(), "Pattern with null character should be rejected");
}
```

### Why It Passes With Mutant

**Mutant**: `replace Pattern::validate → Ok(())`

**Original code**: Already returns `Ok(())` for `Pattern::Literal(_)`
**Mutated code**: Returns `Ok(())` for all patterns

**Test behavior**:
- **With original code**: `validate()` returns `Ok(())` → test FAILS (expects Err)
- **With mutated code**: `validate()` returns `Ok(())` → test FAILS (expects Err)

**Conclusion**: **MY TEST SHOULD HAVE FAILED WITH ORIGINAL CODE TOO!**

---

## Wait... Why Didn't My Test Fail?

Let me check if the test actually runs:

```bash
cargo test test_pattern_validate_rejects_invalid_literal -- --nocapture
```

**Hypothesis**: The test might not be running, or might be in wrong module, or...

**CRITICAL REALIZATION**: If my test expects `Err` but code returns `Ok`, then running `cargo test` should show test FAILURE.

**But we saw**: `857 tests passed` (100% pass rate)

**This means**: Either:
1. Test is not running
2. Test is passing when it shouldn't
3. Test logic is inverted

---

## Investigation Needed

### Check 1: Is test in correct file?

**File**: `rash/src/ast/restricted_test.rs`
**Lines**: 514-521

```rust
#[test]
fn test_pattern_validate_rejects_invalid_literal() {
    let invalid_pattern = Pattern::Literal(Literal::Str("\0invalid".to_string()));
    let result = invalid_pattern.validate();
    assert!(result.is_err(), "Pattern with null character should be rejected");
}
```

**Status**: ✅ Test exists in file

---

### Check 2: Does test module import Pattern?

Need to check imports at top of test file to see if Pattern is accessible.

**Implication**: If Pattern isn't imported, test won't compile.

---

### Check 3: Run specific test

```bash
cargo test --lib test_pattern_validate_rejects_invalid_literal
```

**Expected**: Test should FAIL (because code returns Ok but test expects Err)
**If test PASSES**: Test logic is wrong
**If test NOT FOUND**: Test not being compiled

---

## Broader Pattern

If Pattern::validate doesn't check literals, then probably:

1. **validate_if_stmt** doesn't check condition for null chars
   - It delegates to `condition.validate()`
   - Which checks via `Expr::validate()`
   - Which DOES check null chars in Expr::Literal(Literal::Str)

2. **validate_match_stmt** doesn't check scrutinee for null chars
   - It delegates to `scrutinee.validate()`
   - Which checks via `Expr::validate()`

**Key insight**: Validation is delegated, not done directly.

---

## Hypothesis Revision

### Original Hypothesis (WRONG)
Tests are fundamentally broken and don't work at all.

### Revised Hypothesis (MORE LIKELY)
Tests make incorrect assumptions about what each function validates. Some tests might work, others don't.

**Specifically**:
- Pattern::validate test: WRONG (Pattern doesn't validate literal contents)
- Expr validation tests: MIGHT WORK (Expr::validate does check null chars)
- validate_if_stmt test: MIGHT WORK (delegates to Expr::validate)

---

## What This Means

### Tests That Might Actually Work

1. Expr::validate tests (null char checks)
   - `test_string_literal_rejects_null_characters` ✅ (might work)
   - Expr::validate DOES check `Literal::Str` for null chars (line 377-381)

2. Nesting depth tests
   - `test_expr_nesting_depth_exceeds_limit` ✅ (might work)
   - Expr::validate DOES check depth > 30 (line 370-374)

### Tests That Are Definitely Wrong

1. Pattern::validate test
   - ❌ Pattern::validate doesn't check literal contents
   - Test expects rejection that never happens

2. Validation bypass tests (need investigation)
   - validate_if_stmt → Ok(()) bypass
   - validate_match_stmt → Ok(()) bypass
   - Need to understand what these actually validate

---

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Understand Code Before Testing

**Mistake**: I wrote tests based on what I THOUGHT code should do, not what it ACTUALLY does.

**Fix**: Read actual implementation carefully before writing mutation-killing tests.

---

### Lesson 2: Failing Tests Are Good

**Observation**: When I wrote `test_pattern_validate_rejects_invalid_literal`, cargo test said it PASSED.

**What I should have done**: Immediately investigate why it passed when code returns Ok(()).

**What I did instead**: Assumed test was correct and moved on.

---

### Lesson 3: Mutation Testing Reveals Assumptions

**Value of mutation testing**: It revealed that my tests were based on wrong assumptions.

**Without mutation testing**: I would think tests are good (they pass!).

**With mutation testing**: Discovered tests don't actually test what I thought.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. ✅ Manually run one test to confirm it fails
2. ✅ Check test imports
3. ✅ Verify test structure

### Short-term

1. Review ALL validation functions to understand what they actually validate
2. Rewrite tests based on actual code behavior
3. Re-run mutation testing

### Long-term

1. Document what each validation function actually checks
2. Identify validation gaps (things that should be validated but aren't)
3. Either:
   - Add missing validation to code
   - Accept that validation is limited

## Toyota Way Application

### 現地現物 (Genchi Genbutsu) - Go and See

✅ **Applied**: Read actual code to understand what it does
✅ **Result**: Discovered Pattern::validate doesn't validate literal contents

### 反省 (Hansei) - Reflection

✅ **Applied**: Reflected on why tests failed
✅ **Result**: Identified root cause (incorrect assumptions)

### 改善 (Kaizen) - Continuous Improvement

**Learning**: Always verify assumptions about code before writing tests

**Process Improvement**:
1. Read function implementation
2. Write test based on ACTUAL behavior
3. Verify test fails with mutation
4. Then commit test

---

## Conclusion

**Root Cause**: Tests based on incorrect assumptions about what validation functions actually do.

**Example**: Pattern::validate doesn't check literal contents, but my test assumed it did.

**Impact**: Tests pass with both original and mutated code, so they don't kill mutants.

**Fix**: Understand code behavior first, then write tests based on reality.

**Status**: Root cause identified, need to verify with manual test run.
