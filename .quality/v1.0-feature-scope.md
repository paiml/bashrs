### Partial/Incomplete Features 🟡

#### 1. Playground (10-66% coverage, ~800 uncovered lines)

**Current State**:
- `playground/computation.rs`: 46% coverage
- `playground/document.rs`: 14% coverage
- `playground/editor.rs`: 54% coverage
- `playground/highlighting.rs`: 63% coverage
- `playground/parser.rs`: 13% coverage
- `playground/render.rs`: 66% coverage

**Decision Required**:
- [ ] **Option A**: Complete for v1.0 (15-20 hours work)
- [ ] **Option B**: Mark as experimental/preview (document limitations)
- [ ] **Option C**: Remove from v1.0 (move to v1.1 or separate crate)

**Recommendation**: **Option C - Remove from v1.0**
- Playground is an interactive feature, separate from core transpiler
- Low coverage indicates it's not production-ready
- Core transpiler doesn't depend on it
- Can be released as separate `rash-playground` crate later

#### 2. Binary Compiler (32% coverage, ~100 uncovered lines)

**Current State**:
- `compiler/mod.rs`: 32% coverage
- Self-extracting script: Works (tested)
- Container format: Partial implementation
- Binary optimization: Stub implementation

**Decision Required**:
- [ ] **Option A**: Complete for v1.0 (8-10 hours work)
- [ ] **Option B**: Keep as "beta" feature (document status)
- [ ] **Option C**: Remove compilation, keep transpilation only

**Recommendation**: **Option B - Keep as beta**
- Self-extracting scripts work (tested in CLI)
- Container format can be marked experimental
- Users can still transpile (core feature)
- Binary compilation is advanced/optional feature

#### 3. Testing Infrastructure Stubs (67% coverage, 9 uncovered lines)

**Current State**:
- `testing/fuzz.rs`: Stub
- `testing/mutation.rs`: Stub
- `testing/regression.rs`: Stub

**Decision Required**:
- [ ] **Option A**: Implement fully (6-8 hours)
- [ ] **Option B**: Remove stubs (clean codebase)
- [ ] **Option C**: Keep as internal placeholders

**Recommendation**: **Option B - Remove stubs**
- These are internal testing tools, not user-facing
- Real fuzzing/mutation testing infrastructure already exists (cargo-fuzz, cargo-mutants)
- Removing adds +0.2% coverage for free

### Binary Utilities (0% coverage, ~350 lines)

**Current State**:
- `bin/bashrs.rs`: Main entry point (58% coverage)
- `bin/quality-gate.rs`: CI tool (0% coverage)
- `bin/quality-dashboard.rs`: Metrics tool (0% coverage)
- `bin/rash-metrics.rs`: Stats tool (0% coverage)

**Decision Required**:
- [ ] **Option A**: Add integration tests (6-8 hours)
- [ ] **Option B**: Keep as-is (binaries are thin wrappers)
- [ ] **Option C**: Remove quality tools (internal use only)

**Recommendation**: **Option B - Keep as-is**
- Main binary (bashrs) is tested via CLI integration tests
- Quality tools are for development/CI, not core features
- Thin wrappers around well-tested library code

## v1.0 Feature Scope Decision Matrix

### Include in v1.0 ✅

**Core Transpiler**:
- ✅ Rust → Shell transpilation (POSIX, Bash, Dash, Ash)
- ✅ Full AST parsing and validation
- ✅ Safety verification and escape handling
- ✅ Multi-shell compatibility
- ✅ Optimization passes

**CLI Commands**:
- ✅ `rash build` - transpile Rust to shell
- ✅ `rash check` - validate Rust compatibility
- ✅ `rash init` - scaffold new project
- ✅ `rash verify` - validate shell script matches source
- ✅ `rash inspect` - formal verification reports

**Advanced Features** (beta):
- ✅ Self-extracting scripts (`rash compile --self-extracting`)
- ✅ Container packaging (mark as experimental)
- ✅ Proof generation (`--emit-proof`)

### Defer to v1.1+ 📅

**Interactive Features**:
- 📅 Playground/REPL (move to separate crate or v1.1)
- 📅 Web-based interactive transpiler
- 📅 Live syntax highlighting

**Development Tools** (internal):
- 📅 Quality dashboard (keep for internal CI)
- 📅 Metrics collection (internal use)

### Remove Before v1.0 🗑️

**Incomplete Implementations**:
- 🗑️ Testing infrastructure stubs (`testing/fuzz.rs`, etc.)
- 🗑️ Placeholder optimization modules (if any)
- 🗑️ Unused experimental code

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Cleanup (2-3 hours)

1. **Remove Playground Modules** (if Option C chosen)
   ```bash
   # Remove playground directory
   git rm -r rash/src/playground/

   # Update Cargo.toml
   # Remove playground-related dependencies

   # Update mod.rs
   # Remove playground module declaration
   ```

   **Expected Coverage Impact**: +6-7% → ~86% total

2. **Remove Testing Stubs**
   ```bash
   git rm rash/src/testing/fuzz.rs
   git rm rash/src/testing/mutation.rs
   git rm rash/src/testing/regression.rs
   # Keep testing/mod.rs with mod declarations removed
   ```

   **Expected Coverage Impact**: +0.2% → ~86.2% total

3. **Clean Binary Utilities** (optional)
   - Keep `bin/bashrs.rs` (main entry point)
   - Move quality tools to `tools/` directory (not part of main crate)

   **Expected Coverage Impact**: +2% → ~88% total

**Total Expected Coverage After Cleanup**: **~88-90%**

### Phase 2: Documentation (4-6 hours)

   - Testing stubs: Remove or implement?

2. **Create Cleanup PR**
   - Remove decided features
   - Update documentation
   - Run coverage analysis

3. **Start Documentation Sprint**
   - Create user guide outline
   - Draft API documentation
   - Write example use cases

4. **Set Release Date**
   - Based on timeline estimate
   - Account for feedback/iterations
   - Plan announcement strategy

## Recommendations

**For Fastest Path to v1.0** ⚡:
1. Remove playground modules → +6% coverage
2. Remove testing stubs → +0.2% coverage
3. Keep compiler as beta
4. Expected: **~86% total coverage in 2-3 hours**
5. Focus remaining time on documentation

**For Highest Quality v1.0** 🏆:
1. Complete playground → +6% coverage (15-20 hours)
2. Complete compiler → +1% coverage (8-10 hours)
3. Comprehensive docs → (4-6 hours)
4. Expected: **~87% total coverage in 27-36 hours**

**My Recommendation**: **Fast Path ⚡**
- Current quality is already excellent
- Focus on user-facing documentation
- Release sooner, iterate based on feedback
- Save advanced features for v1.1
