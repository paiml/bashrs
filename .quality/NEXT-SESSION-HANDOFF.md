# Next Session Handoff - Sprint 29

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** Critical bug discovered, ready to fix
**Priority:** HIGH - Fix module declaration to enable tests

---

## Quick Start

**Problem:** Tests written but not compiled due to missing module declaration

**Fix Required:**
```bash
# Add this line to rash/src/ast/mod.rs:
#[cfg(test)]
mod restricted_test;
```

**Verification:**
```bash
cargo test --lib 2>&1 | grep "test result"
# Should show 872 tests (currently 857)
```

---

## What Happened

Session 2 wrote 15 mutation-killing tests to improve AST kill rate from 45.5% to ≥90%. Mutation testing showed 0% improvement, leading to investigation that revealed: **tests were never compiled due to missing module declaration.**

---

## Current State

### Files Modified
1. `rash/src/ast/restricted_test.rs` - 15 tests added (573 lines)
2. `.quality/` - 3,088 lines of documentation

### Git Status
- 8 commits made documenting journey
- All changes committed
- No pending changes

### Test Status
- **Tests written:** 15
- **Tests compiled:** 0 (module not declared)
- **Tests run:** 0
- **Current test count:** 857
- **Expected after fix:** 872

### Mutation Testing Results
- **Baseline:** 66 mutants, 30 caught (45.5%)

## Step-by-Step Fix Guide

### Step 1: Add Module Declaration

**File:** `rash/src/ast/mod.rs`

**Action:** Add at end of file:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod restricted_test;
```

**Why:** Rust requires explicit module declarations

---

### Step 2: Verify Tests Compile

```bash
cargo test --lib 2>&1 | grep "test result"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
test result: ok. 872 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored
```

**If different:** Investigate compilation errors

---

### Step 3: Run Specific Test

```bash
cargo test --lib test_pattern_validate_rejects_invalid_literal -- --nocapture
```

**Expected:** Test should RUN (might FAIL - that's OK for now)

**If "0 tests found":** Module still not declared correctly

---

### Step 4: Fix Test Assumptions

**Known Issues:**

1. **Pattern::validate doesn't check literal contents**
   - Test: `test_pattern_validate_rejects_invalid_literal`
   - Assumption: Pattern::validate checks for null chars
   - Reality: Returns Ok(()) for all literals
   - **Action:** Either remove test OR add validation to code

2. **Other validation functions may not do what tests expect**
   - Review each test's assumptions
   - Read actual implementation
   - Fix tests to match reality

---

### Step 5: Re-run Mutation Testing

```bash
cargo mutants --file 'rash/src/ast/restricted.rs' --output /tmp/mutants-ast-fixed.log -- --lib
```

**Target:** ≥42/65 mutants caught (≥65% kill rate)
- Accounting for ~16-18 wildcard survivors
- ≥90% of testable mutants

---

### Step 6: Analyze Results

```bash
# Count results
TOTAL=$(grep "Found.*mutants" /tmp/mutants-ast-fixed.log | grep -oE '[0-9]+')
MISSED=$(grep -c "MISSED" /tmp/mutants-ast-fixed.log)
CAUGHT=$((TOTAL - MISSED))
RATE=$((CAUGHT * 100 / TOTAL))

echo "Results: $CAUGHT/$TOTAL caught ($RATE%)"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Kill rate ≥65% (accounting for wildcards)
- OR ≥90% of non-wildcard mutants

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Tests Work (Best Case)

**If kill rate ≥65%:**
- ✅ Tests are effective
- ✅ Document success
- ✅ Move to next module (Emitter)

---

### Scenario 2: Tests Partially Work (Likely)

**If kill rate 50-64%:**
- Some tests work, some have issues
- Identify which tests are effective
- Fix or remove ineffective tests
- Iterate until ≥65%

---

### Scenario 3: Tests Don't Work (Possible)

**If kill rate ≤50%:**
- Most tests based on wrong assumptions
- Review what functions actually validate
- Rewrite tests based on actual behavior
- Consider adding missing validation to code

---

## Known Issues

### Issue 1: Wildcard Match Arms

**Impact:** ~16-18 mutants untestable

**Files:** See `.quality/sprint29-wildcard-analysis.md`

**Resolution:** Accept as Category D (Acceptable Survivors)

**Target Adjustment:** ≥90% of testable mutants = ≥65% of total

---

### Issue 2: Pattern::validate

**Problem:** Doesn't validate literal contents

**Code:**
```rust
Pattern::Literal(_) | Pattern::Variable(_) | Pattern::Wildcard => Ok(())
```

**Test Affected:** `test_pattern_validate_rejects_invalid_literal`

**Options:**
1. Remove test (validation not done)
2. Add validation to Pattern::validate
3. Accept that Pattern doesn't validate literals

---

### Issue 3: Unknown Validation Behaviors

**Recommendation:** For each test, verify:
1. What does the function actually validate?
2. Does test assumption match reality?
3. If not, fix test OR add validation

---

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Acceptable
- [ ] Tests compile (test count = 872)
- [ ] Tests run without errors
- [ ] Kill rate ≥50% (some improvement)

### Target
- [ ] Tests compile
- [ ] Tests run
- [ ] Kill rate ≥65% (≥90% of testable)
- [ ] Document results

### Stretch Goal
- [ ] Kill rate ≥90% overall
- [ ] All non-wildcard mutants caught
- [ ] Move to Emitter module

---

## Time Estimate

- **Step 1 (Module declaration):** 5 minutes
- **Step 2 (Verify compile):** 2 minutes
- **Step 3 (Run test):** 5 minutes
- **Step 4 (Fix assumptions):** 30-60 minutes
- **Step 5 (Re-run mutation):** 30-60 minutes
- **Step 6 (Analyze):** 15 minutes

**Total:** 1.5-2.5 hours

---

## Questions to Answer

1. Do tests compile after module declaration?
2. What is actual test count after fix?
3. Which tests work as expected?
4. Which tests have wrong assumptions?
5. What is kill rate after fixes?
6. Are we ≥90% of testable mutants?
7. What are remaining survivors?

---

## Documentation to Create

After completing fixes:

1. **Sprint 29 AST Completion Report**
   - Before/after comparison
   - Tests that worked
   - Tests that didn't work
   - Final kill rate
   - Lessons learned

2. **Update ROADMAP.yaml**
   - Mark AST module complete (or in-progress)
   - Document kill rate achieved
   - Note wildcard limitation

3. **Next Steps for Sprint 29**
   - Emitter module (152 mutants)
   - Bash Parser module (287 mutants)
   - Final sprint report

---

## Key Learnings to Apply

1. **Always verify test count** after adding tests
2. **Read actual code** before assuming behavior
3. **Run specific tests** to verify they work
4. **Use mutation testing** as quality gate
5. **Green tests** don't guarantee effectiveness

## Contact Points

**Questions?** Review:
- `.quality/sprint29-final-root-cause.md`
- `.quality/sprint29-session2-final-summary.md`

**Issues?** Check:
- Test compilation errors
- Module declaration syntax
- Test assumptions vs reality

---

## Quick Reference

**Add module:**
```rust
// In rash/src/ast/mod.rs
#[cfg(test)]
mod restricted_test;
```

**Verify:**
```bash
cargo test --lib 2>&1 | grep "passed"
```

```
872 passed
```

**Re-run mutation testing:**
```bash
cargo mutants --file 'rash/src/ast/restricted.rs' -- --lib
```

≥65% kill rate (≥42/65 mutants)
