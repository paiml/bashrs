# Priority: parser, IR converter, emitter, validation

# Use cargo nextest for faster execution

# Baseline target: ≥90% kill rate overall
# Module-specific targets:
# - Parser: ≥92% (~150 mutants expected)
# - IR: ≥90% (~120 mutants expected)
# - Emitter: ≥90% (~100 mutants expected)
# - Validation: ≥95% (~60 mutants expected)
