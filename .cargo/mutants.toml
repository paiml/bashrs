# Mutation Testing Configuration for Rash
# See: https://mutants.rs/config.html
#
# IMPORTANT: Run LOCALLY only - too slow for GitHub Actions CI
# Usage: make mutants           (full ~60min)
#        make mutation-file FILE=path/to/file.rs (single file ~5min)
#        make mutants-quick     (changed files ~10min)

# Test only the main rash package (exclude rash-mcp which has external deps)
test_package = ["bashrs"]

# Increase timeout for property tests (they can be slow)
timeout_multiplier = 2.0

# Files to always skip
exclude_globs = [
    "**/tests/**",
    "**/benches/**",
    "**/*_test.rs",
]

# Don't test generated code or vendored dependencies
exclude_re = [
    "generated",
    "vendor",
]
