# Feature Request - EXTREME TDD

## Feature Overview

**Priority**: [P0 Critical / P1 High / P2 Medium / P3 Low]

### Feature Name
[Concise name for the feature]

### Problem Statement
[What problem does this solve? Why is it needed?]

### User Story
As a [type of user],
I want [feature],
So that [benefit].

### Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Design
[Describe the solution at a high level]

### Example Usage

```rust
// Example Rust code using the new feature
fn main() {
    // Demonstrate the feature
}
```

**Generated Shell Code** (expected):
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# What the transpiled output should look like
```

### Alternative Solutions
[Other approaches considered and why this one is better]

## Technical Specification

### Requirements
- [ ] [Requirement 1]
- [ ] [Requirement 2]
- [ ] [Requirement 3]

### Critical Invariants
Which of these must be maintained?
- [ ] POSIX compliance (shellcheck -s sh passes)
- [ ] Determinism (byte-identical output)
- [ ] Safety (no injection vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Performance (<100ms for minimal scripts)
- [ ] Code size (<20 lines overhead)

### Components Affected
- [ ] Parser (`src/parser/`)
- [ ] IR (`src/ir/`)
- [ ] Emitter (`src/emitter/`)
- [ ] Verifier (`src/verifier/`)
- [ ] Standard library
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Examples

### Complexity Estimate
- **Parser changes**: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
- **IR changes**: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
- **Emitter changes**: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
- **Overall complexity**: [1-10 scale]

## EXTREME TDD Plan

### RED Phase: Tests First

#### Unit Tests
```rust
#[test]
fn test_feature_basic() {
    // This test should FAIL initially
    let input = "...";
    let expected = "...";
    assert_eq!(transpile(input).unwrap(), expected);
}

#[test]
fn test_feature_edge_case_1() {
    // Test edge case
}

#[test]
fn test_feature_error_handling() {
    // Test error conditions
}
```

#### Property Tests
```rust
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn prop_feature_invariant(input in generate_valid_input()) {
        let output = transpile(&input).unwrap();
        // Assert property holds
        prop_assert!(check_property(&output));
    }
}
```

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] ShellCheck validation
- [ ] Determinism verification
- [ ] Cross-shell compatibility (sh, dash, ash, busybox)

### GREEN Phase: Minimal Implementation

**Estimated effort**: [X hours/days]

**Implementation order**:
1. [Step 1: Parser changes]
2. [Step 2: IR changes]
3. [Step 3: Emitter changes]
4. [Step 4: Validation]

### REFACTOR Phase: Quality

**Quality targets**:
- [ ] Complexity ≤10 (cyclomatic), ≤15 (cognitive)
- [ ] No SATD comments
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Examples added

## Quality Gates

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Property tests (at least 3 new properties)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Doc tests
- [ ] ShellCheck validation
- [ ] Determinism tests

### Coverage Requirements
- [ ] Core module coverage ≥85%
- [ ] New code coverage ≥90%

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] No regression in transpile time
- [ ] Benchmark new feature if performance-critical
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable

### Security Requirements
- [ ] No shell injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Proper input escaping
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Edge Cases

### Identified Edge Cases
1. [Edge case 1]
2. [Edge case 2]
3. [Edge case 3]

### Stress Testing
- [ ] Empty input
- [ ] Very large input
- [ ] Deeply nested structures (100+ levels)
- [ ] Unicode/special characters
- [ ] Malformed input
