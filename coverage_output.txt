📊 Running comprehensive test coverage analysis...
🔍 Checking for cargo-llvm-cov and cargo-nextest...
🧹 Cleaning old coverage data...
⚙️  Temporarily disabling global cargo config (mold breaks coverage)...
🧪 Phase 1: Running tests with instrumentation (no report)...
info: cargo-llvm-cov currently setting cfg(coverage) and cfg(coverage_nightly); you can opt-out it by passing --no-cfg-coverage and --no-cfg-coverage-nightly
