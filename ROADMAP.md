## Current Status: Sprint 7 Complete | Ready for Sprint 8 🎯

### Sprint History
**Sprint 1**: Critical bug fixes (5 bugs, 22 property tests)
**Sprint 2**: Quality gates (24 ShellCheck tests, determinism)
**Sprint 3**: Security hardening (27 adversarial tests, injection prevention)
**Sprint 4**: Parser fixes + **100% test pass rate** ✅
**Sprint 5**: Coverage infrastructure (BLOCKED → RESOLVED)
**Sprint 6**: Performance benchmarks (SKIPPED - moved to Sprint 7)
**Sprint 7**: **Complexity reduction** (96% cognitive complexity reduction) ✅

### 🎯 Project Goals (Derived from CLAUDE.md)
Rash is a **Rust-to-Shell transpiler** with these critical invariants:
1. **POSIX compliance**: Every generated script must pass `shellcheck -s sh`
2. **Determinism**: Same Rust input must produce byte-identical shell output
3. **Safety**: No user input can escape proper quoting in generated scripts
4. **Performance**: Generated install.sh must execute in <100ms for minimal scripts
5. **Code size**: Runtime overhead should not exceed 20 lines of shell boilerplate

### 📊 Current Metrics (Post-Sprint 7)

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Test Suite** | 513 passing, 3 ignored | 600+ passing, 0 ignored | 🟢 Strong |
| **Property Tests** | 23 properties (~13,300 cases) | 30+ properties | 🟢 Excellent |
| **Coverage** | 82.14% line, 82.68% function | >85% line | 🟡 Close to target |
| **Complexity** | Median: 1.0, Top: 15 | All <10 | 🟢 Excellent |

## 🚀 Sprint Plan - EXTREME TDD Methodology

### Sprint 8: Remaining Complexity Reduction (IN PROGRESS)
**Goal**: Reduce complexity of remaining high-complexity functions
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Philosophy**: 改善 (Kaizen) - Continuous improvement

#### Targets (from pmat analysis):
1. ~~**analyze_directory** (cognitive 49) → target <10~~ (bin utility, not critical path)
2. **parse** (cognitive 35 → 5) ✅ COMPLETE (86% reduction)
3. **Additional functions** as identified by pmat (next)

#### Tasks:
- [ ] TICKET-4003: Refactor analyze_directory (SKIPPED - bin utility, not core)
- ✅ **TICKET-4004**: Refactor parse function (cognitive 35 → 5, 86% reduction)
- ✅ Run pmat verification after refactor
- ✅ Maintain 100% test pass rate (520/520 passing)
- [ ] Identify remaining high-complexity functions
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md with Sprint 8 completion

**Success Criteria**:
- 🟡 All **core** functions <10 complexity (parse ✅, checking others...)
- ✅ 100% test pass rate maintained (520 tests)
- ✅ No regressions introduced

**Progress**:
- ✅ TICKET-4004 complete: parse function (35 → 5, 86% reduction)
- ✅ 7 new unit tests added
- ✅ 4 helper functions extracted
- ✅ All **core transpiler** functions now <10 cognitive complexity
- 🟡 Non-critical functions (bin utilities, verifiers) have some >10 complexity
- **Decision**: Sprint 8 target ACHIEVED for core functionality

**Identified High-Complexity Functions (non-critical)**:
- `walk_ir` (cognitive 22) - verifier/properties.rs (not transpiler core)
- `walk_rust_files` (cognitive 18) - bin/quality-dashboard.rs (tooling)
- These are deferred to future optimization sprints

---

### Sprint 9: Coverage Enhancement (PLANNED)
**Goal**: Achieve >85% line coverage
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Current**: 82.14% line coverage (close to target!)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ >85% line coverage
- ✅ >85% function coverage
- ✅ >85% region coverage

---

### Sprint 10: Performance Optimization (PLANNED)
**Goal**: Optimize transpilation performance
**Duration**: 2-3 hours

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Run criterion benchmarks comprehensively
- [ ] Profile memory usage
- [ ] Optimize hot paths if needed
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

**Note**: Current performance already exceeds targets significantly. May skip if no bottlenecks found.

### Sprint 11: Property Test Enhancement (PLANNED)
**Goal**: Expand property test coverage
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Current**: 23 properties, ~13,300 cases

#### Missing Properties (identified):
- [ ] **prop_control_flow_preserves_semantics** - if/else correctness
- [ ] **prop_function_call_argument_order** - Argument order preserved
- [ ] **prop_error_messages_actionable** - Error quality
- [ ] **prop_shell_dialect_compatibility** - Cross-shell compatibility

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement 4 new property tests
- [ ] Increase case counts for critical paths (1000→5000)
- [ ] Add mutation testing to verify property strength
- [ ] Document property coverage story

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 30+ property tests

make coverage-clean  # Clean artifacts
```

### Testing (Comprehensive)

make test-all        # Comprehensive (adds shells + determinism)
make test-fast       # Fast unit tests only
make test-doc        # Documentation tests
make test-property   # Property-based tests (~13,300 cases)
make test-example    # Transpile all examples + ShellCheck
make test-shells     # Cross-shell compatibility
make test-determinism # Determinism verification
```

### CI/CD
✅ **GitHub Actions updated**:
- Coverage job with two-phase LLVM pattern
- Uses `taiki-e/install-action` for cargo-llvm-cov + nextest
