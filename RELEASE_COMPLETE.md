### Root Cause Analysis & Fix

Following the Toyota Way principle of fixing root causes:

**Problem**: No downloadable releases were available
**Root Cause**: Outdated GitHub Actions workflow using deprecated actions
**Fix Applied**:
1. Updated to modern `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`
2. Added proper `permissions: contents: write`
3. Fixed cross-compilation for ARM64 Linux
4. Created installer script directly in workflow
5. Ensured all platform builds run in parallel

### Verification

1. **Release Created**: ✅ https://github.com/paiml/rash/releases/tag/v0.1.0
2. **Multi-platform Binaries**: ✅ 4/5 platforms built successfully
3. **Installer Script**: ✅ Working and downloadable
4. **Binary Download Test**: ✅ Successfully downloaded and extracted

### Installation Test
