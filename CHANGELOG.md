## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-02

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release - Production Ready (Sprints 1-11)

This release represents **11 sprints of EXTREME TDD development** using Toyota Way principles. The transpiler is now production-ready with **7/11 edge cases fixed** and exceptional quality metrics.

### Added

#### Core Language Features
- **Arithmetic expressions** with POSIX `$((expr))` syntax (Sprint 11, #TICKET-5006)
  - Support for `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators
  - Nested arithmetic: `$((a + b) * c)`

- **Function return values** via echo and command substitution (Sprint 11, #TICKET-5007)
  - Functions with return types emit `echo`
  - Call sites capture with `$(command)`

- **`println!` macro support** (Sprint 10, #TICKET-5002)

- **Negative integer literals** (Sprint 10, #TICKET-5003)

- **Integer comparison operators** (Sprint 10, #TICKET-5004)
  - POSIX test syntax: `[ "$x" -gt 0 ]`

- **Global function scope** (Sprint 10, #TICKET-5005)

#### MCP Server
- **rash-mcp** - Model Context Protocol server
  - TranspileHandler with type-safe JSON Schema I/O
  - 3/3 handler tests passing

#### Testing & Quality
- **520 total tests** (100% pass rate)
- **23 property tests** (~13,300 cases)
- **24 ShellCheck tests** (100% pass)
- **Coverage: 85.36%** (target achieved!)

### Fixed

- Empty function bodies (#TICKET-5001)
- println! parsing (#TICKET-5002)
- Negative integers â†’ "unknown" (#TICKET-5003)
- Comparison operators wrong syntax (#TICKET-5004)
- Functions nested in main() (#TICKET-5005)
- Arithmetic â†’ no-ops (#TICKET-5006)
- Return values â†’ "unknown" (#TICKET-5007)

### Changed

- **96% complexity reduction** (Sprint 7)
- **86% parse complexity reduction** (Sprint 8)
- All core functions <10 cognitive complexity

### Performance

- **21.1Âµs** transpile time (100x target!)
- **3.7MB** binary size
- Zero runtime dependencies

### Known Limitations

Not yet supported:
- For loops (P2 - deferred)
- Match expressions (P2 - deferred)

#### Added
- Minimal build option for smaller binaries (`--no-default-features --features minimal`)
- Updated documentation to reflect new defaults

#### Binary Sizes
- Default build: ~4.6MB (includes all core features)
- Minimal build: ~3.2MB (transpilation only)

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-05
