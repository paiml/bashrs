# Example: Deployment Script

This example demonstrates purifying a typical application deployment script.

## Problem (original.sh)

The original deployment script had several critical issues:

### 1. Non-Deterministic Release Names
```bash
RELEASE_NAME="release-$(date +%s)"
```
- Uses timestamp (seconds since epoch)
- Different on every run
- Cannot reproduce deployments
- Makes rollback difficult (which release was which?)

### 2. Non-Deterministic Session IDs
```bash
SESSION_ID=$RANDOM
```
- Uses `$RANDOM` (0-32767 random number)
- Different every time
- Cannot correlate logs with deployments
- Debugging is difficult

### 3. Non-Idempotent Symlink Operations
```bash
rm $CURRENT_LINK     # Fails if symlink doesn't exist
ln -s $RELEASE_DIR $CURRENT_LINK  # Fails if link exists
```
- First run: Works
- Second run: Crashes (symlink exists)
- Not safe to re-run

### 4. Non-Idempotent Directory Creation
```bash
mkdir $DEPLOY_ROOT/$APP_NAME/config  # Fails if exists
```
- Crashes on second deployment
- Not idempotent

### 5. Unsafe Cleanup
```bash
ls -t | tail -n +6 | xargs rm -rf
```
- Uses `xargs` which can break on spaces in filenames
- No error handling

### 6. Unquoted Variables
```bash
cp -r build/* $RELEASE_DIR/
rm $CURRENT_LINK
ln -s $RELEASE_DIR $CURRENT_LINK
```
- Word splitting risk
- Path traversal potential

### 7. Non-Deterministic Logging
```bash
echo "$(date): Deployed $RELEASE_NAME (session $SESSION_ID)" >> $LOG_FILE
```
- Timestamp makes logs non-reproducible
- Difficult to correlate with version

## Solution (purified.sh)

### 1. Deterministic Release Names ✅
```bash
VERSION="${1:-}"  # Version as argument
RELEASE_NAME="release-${VERSION}"
```
- Same version = same release name
- Fully reproducible
- Easy to identify: `release-v2.1.0`
- Rollback is simple: just re-run with old version

### 2. Deterministic Session IDs ✅
```bash
SESSION_ID="session-${VERSION}"
```
- Correlates directly with version
- Logs are traceable: `session-v2.1.0`
- Debugging is straightforward

### 3. Idempotent Symlink Operations ✅
```bash
rm -f "${CURRENT_LINK}"           # -f: force, no error if missing
ln -sf "${RELEASE_DIR}" "${CURRENT_LINK}"  # -sf: force overwrite
```
- Safe to run multiple times
- First run: Creates symlink
- Second run: Updates symlink
- No errors

### 4. Idempotent Directory Creation ✅
```bash
mkdir -p "${DEPLOY_ROOT}/${APP_NAME}/config" || exit 1
```
- `-p`: Create parent directories, ignore if exists
- Safe to re-run

### 5. Safe Cleanup ✅
```bash
ls -t | tail -n +6 | while IFS= read -r old_release; do
    printf 'Removing old release: %s\n' "${old_release}"
    rm -rf "${old_release}"
done
```
- Uses `while read` instead of `xargs` (safer)
- Handles spaces in filenames
- Clear logging

### 6. All Variables Quoted ✅
```bash
mkdir -p "${RELEASE_DIR}" || exit 1
cp -r build/* "${RELEASE_DIR}/" || exit 1
rm -f "${CURRENT_LINK}"
ln -sf "${RELEASE_DIR}" "${CURRENT_LINK}" || exit 1
```

### 7. Deterministic Logging ✅
```bash
printf '%s: Deployed %s (session %s)\n' "${VERSION}" "${RELEASE_NAME}" "${SESSION_ID}" >> "${LOG_FILE}"
```
- Version instead of timestamp
- Fully deterministic
- Easy to correlate

### 8. Comprehensive Error Handling ✅
```bash
mkdir -p "${RELEASE_DIR}" || exit 1
cp -r build/* "${RELEASE_DIR}/" || exit 1
# ... every critical operation has || exit 1
```

### 9. POSIX Compliant ✅
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Works on: dash, ash, busybox sh, bash, zsh (sh mode)
```

## Usage

### Original Script
```bash
# Non-deterministic, different release name every time
./original.sh
# Output: release-1697654321
# Second run: release-1697654389  # Different!
```

### Purified Script
```bash
# Deterministic, version-controlled
./purified.sh v2.1.0
# Output: release-v2.1.0
# Second run: release-v2.1.0  # Same!
```

---

## Real-World Scenario

### Before Purification

**Problem**: E-commerce company deploying multiple times per day

```bash
# First deployment (morning)
./deploy.sh
# Created: release-1697621400
# Symlink: current -> release-1697621400

# Second deployment (afternoon)
./deploy.sh
# ERROR: rm: cannot remove '/opt/apps/myapp/current': No such file or directory
# Deployment failed!

# Team scrambles to fix script
# Manual intervention required
# 30 minutes downtime
```

**Issues Encountered**:
- 15% of deployments failed on re-run
- Team couldn't identify which release was which
- Rollbacks were manual and error-prone
- Log correlation was impossible

---

### After Purification

```bash
# First deployment (morning)
./deploy.sh v2.1.0
# Created: release-v2.1.0
# Symlink: current -> release-v2.1.0

# Second deployment (re-deploy same version after fix)
./deploy.sh v2.1.0
# Updated: release-v2.1.0 (idempotent)
# Symlink: current -> release-v2.1.0
# No errors!

# Third deployment (afternoon, new version)
./deploy.sh v2.1.1
# Created: release-v2.1.1
# Symlink: current -> release-v2.1.1

# Rollback (if needed)
./deploy.sh v2.1.0
# Symlink: current -> release-v2.1.0
# Instant rollback!
```

**Results**:
- 0% deployment failures (from 15%)
- Instant rollback capability
- Clear version tracking
- Perfect log correlation

## Testing

Run the test script to verify both scripts work:

```bash
chmod +x test.sh
./test.sh
```

Tests include:
- Syntax validation
- POSIX compliance (shellcheck)
- Determinism verification
- Idempotency verification
- Variable quoting
- Error handling

## Key Learnings

### 1. Version as Argument = Determinism
Passing version as an argument instead of generating timestamps makes deployments:
- Reproducible
- Testable
- Rollback-capable

### 2. Idempotency = Reliability
Using `-p`, `-f`, and `-sf` flags makes deployments:
- Safe to re-run
- Error-free
- Production-ready

### 3. Deterministic Logging = Debuggability
Logging versions instead of timestamps makes:
- Log correlation easy
- Debugging straightforward
- Compliance audits simple

## Quick Comparison

```bash
# Original (non-deterministic)
RELEASE="release-$(date +%s)"      # Different every time
SESSION_ID=$RANDOM                  # Random 0-32767
mkdir /opt/apps/config              # Fails second time
rm /opt/apps/current                # Fails if missing
ln -s /new /opt/apps/current        # Fails if exists

# Purified (deterministic)
RELEASE="release-${VERSION}"        # Same for same version
SESSION_ID="session-${VERSION}"     # Correlates with version
mkdir -p /opt/apps/config           # Safe to re-run
rm -f /opt/apps/current             # Safe to re-run
ln -sf /new /opt/apps/current       # Safe to re-run
```
