## 🎯 Next Steps (Monday, November 11)

### High Priority
1. **Fix 8 Pre-existing REPL Tests** (Optional - if needed)
   - File: test_repl_history_search.rs (currently gitignored)
   - Impact: Blocks mutation testing only
   - Status: Unrelated to v6.32.1 changes

2. **Run Mutation Testing** (After REPL tests fixed)
   - Target: ≥90% kill rate on sc2154.rs
   - Blocked by: 8 pre-existing test failures
   - Command: `cargo mutants --file rash/src/linter/rules/sc2154.rs`

3. **Monitor v6.32.1 Release**
   - Watch docs.rs build completion
   - Monitor GitHub Issues for user feedback
   - Track download metrics on crates.io

### Medium Priority
4. **Technical Debt Cleanup**
   - 1 critical item
   - 4 high priority items
   - Run: `pmat analyze satd --path rash/src`

5. **Issue Backlog**
   - Issue #13: Dockerfile scoring for FROM scratch
   - Issue #12: Scientific benchmarking enhancements
   - Issue #4: PMAT TDG enforcement
   - Issue #3: AST-based function analysis (SC2119/SC2120)
