# Sprint 117: ROADMAP Audit & Coverage Analysis

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Sprint ID**: SPRINT-117
**Duration**: 1 hour
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Type**: Documentation Audit & Analysis

## Executive Summary

Sprint 117 was planned as a linter expansion sprint to reach 85% coverage. However, comprehensive analysis revealed the **ROADMAP.yaml was significantly outdated**, and the project has **already achieved 99.4% ShellCheck SC2xxx coverage** (323/325 rules).

## Initial Assumption vs. Reality

### Assumed State (from ROADMAP.yaml)
- Version: v5.0.0
- Tests: 3,945 passing
- Rules: 240 active (80% coverage)
- Target: Implement SC2251-SC2265 for 85%

### **Actual State** (Discovered)
- ✅ Version: **v6.2.0** (not v5.0.0)
- ✅ Tests: **4,756 passing** (not 3,945) - **+811 tests**
- ✅ SC2xxx Rules: **323 active** (not 240) - **+83 rules**
- ✅ Coverage: **99.4%** (323/325), not 80%!
- ✅ Total Rules (all types): **357 rules**

## Detailed Analysis

### Rule Breakdown

**ShellCheck-Equivalent Rules (SC2xxx)**:
- SC2001-SC2118: ✅ Complete (118 rules)
- **SC2119-SC2120**: ❌ Deferred (2 rules - false positives without AST)
- SC2121-SC2325: ✅ Complete (205 rules)
- **Total Active**: 323/325 = **99.4% coverage**

**Custom bashrs Rules**:
- DET001-DET003: ✅ 3 determinism rules
- IDEM001-IDEM003: ✅ 3 idempotency rules
- SEC001-SEC008: ✅ 8 security rules
- MAKE001-MAKE020: ✅ 20 Makefile rules

**Grand Total**: **357 active linter rules**

### SC2119/SC2120 Investigation

**Finding**: These rules exist and are fully implemented, but are intentionally disabled.

**Status**:
- ✅ Implementation complete with regex-based function analysis
- ✅ 10 tests per rule (20 tests total)
- ❌ **12 tests fail** when enabled (false positives)
- ❌ Require proper AST-based function call analysis

**Action Taken**:
- Attempted to enable rules
- Discovered false positive bugs
- **STOP THE LINE**: Reverted immediately (zero regressions policy)
- Updated TODO comments with accurate reasoning

### Test Count Analysis

**Before v6.2.0** (per ROADMAP): 3,945 tests
**Actual v6.2.0**: 4,756 tests
**Difference**: +811 tests (20.5% increase)

**Breakdown**:
- Library tests: 4,756 passing
- Ignored tests: 24
- Pass rate: **100%** (zero failures)

### Coverage Beyond SC2xxx

The project's coverage extends beyond ShellCheck equivalents:

| Rule Type | Count | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| SC2xxx | 323 | ShellCheck-equivalent linting |
| DET | 3 | Determinism enforcement |
| IDEM | 3 | Idempotency enforcement |
| SEC | 8 | Security vulnerabilities |
| MAKE | 20 | Makefile quality |
| **Total** | **357** | **Comprehensive shell safety** |

## Findings Summary

### 1. ROADMAP.yaml Severely Outdated

**Last Updated**: Appears to be v5.0.0 era
**Versions Behind**: v5.0.0 → v6.2.0 (2 major versions)
**Metrics Gap**:
- Rules: 240 → 323 (+34.6%)
- Tests: 3,945 → 4,756 (+20.5%)
- Coverage: 80% → 99.4% (+19.4pp)

### 2. Near-Complete ShellCheck Coverage

The project is **1.6% away from 100%** SC2xxx coverage:
- Only 2 rules remain: SC2119, SC2120
- Both require AST-based function analysis
- Current regex-based implementations have false positives

### 3. Documentation Drift

**Impact**:
- ❌ Misleading project status (understates achievement)
- ❌ Sprint planning based on incorrect baseline
- ❌ External contributors might underestimate maturity

**Root Cause**:
- ROADMAP updates lagged behind rapid development
- Focus on implementation over documentation maintenance
- No automated ROADMAP validation

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Sprint 118)

1. **Update ROADMAP.yaml** (THIS SPRINT)
   - Reflect v6.2.0 actual state
   - Correct all metrics (tests, rules, coverage)
   - Add v6.0.0, v6.1.0, v6.2.0 release entries

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
   - Document v6.0.0 - v6.2.0 achievements
   - Clarify rule count methodology

3. **Create SC2119/SC2120 Issue**
   - Document AST requirement
   - Link to false positive test failures
   - Defer to future AST implementation phase

### Short-Term (Next 2-4 weeks)

4. **Automated Documentation Validation**
   - Script to extract metrics from codebase
   - CI check to flag ROADMAP drift
   - Enforce ROADMAP updates in release checklist

5. **Coverage Calculation Standardization**
   - Define methodology clearly
   - Separate SC2xxx vs total rules
   - Document in CLAUDE.md

### Long-Term (v7.0+)

6. **AST-Based Linter Infrastructure**
   - Implement proper bash AST parser
   - Enable SC2119/SC2120 with AST analysis
   - Reach true 100% SC2xxx coverage

7. **Expand Beyond ShellCheck**
   - SC1xxx series (syntax errors)
   - SC3xxx series (optional enhancements)
   - Custom bashrs-specific rules

## Sprint 117 Outcomes

### What Was Accomplished
- ✅ Comprehensive codebase audit
- ✅ Discovered actual project state (v6.2.0, 99.4%)
- ✅ Identified ROADMAP.yaml drift
- ✅ Investigated SC2119/SC2120 issues
- ✅ Documented findings thoroughly
- ✅ Maintained zero regressions (4,756 tests passing)

### What Was NOT Done
- ❌ Did not implement new rules (none needed!)
- ❌ Did not reach 85% (already at 99.4%!)
- ❌ Sprint 117 plan obsolete before execution

### Value Delivered
- **Critical documentation accuracy** restored
- **Project maturity** properly represented
- **Foundation** for v7.0 planning
- **Zero regressions** maintained throughout

## Lessons Learned

### Process Improvements Needed

1. **ROADMAP Maintenance**
   - Update ROADMAP.yaml in EVERY release
   - Make it part of release checklist
   - Automate metrics extraction where possible

2. **Metrics Validation**
   - CI job to validate ROADMAP metrics
   - Script to count rules, tests automatically
   - Fail build if metrics drift >5%

3. **Sprint Planning**
   - Verify ROADMAP accuracy BEFORE sprint planning
   - Quick sanity check of claimed vs. actual state
   - 5-minute audit can save hours of misdirection

### What Worked Well

- ✅ **Zero regressions policy**: Immediately reverted SC2119/SC2120 when tests failed
- ✅ **Thorough investigation**: Didn't stop at surface-level findings
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive sprint findings document
- ✅ **EXTREME TDD mindset**: Trusted the tests, reverted when they failed

## Next Steps

**Sprint 118** (Immediate):
1. Update ROADMAP.yaml with v6.2.0 state
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create GitHub issue for SC2119/SC2120
4. Commit documentation fixes

**Future Sprints**:
- Sprint 119: Implement automated ROADMAP validation
- Sprint 120: Expand to SC1xxx series (syntax errors)
- Sprint 121: Begin AST-based linter infrastructure

## Conclusion

Sprint 117 transformed from a linter expansion sprint into a **critical documentation audit**. While no new rules were implemented, the sprint delivered **significant value** by:

1. Discovering the project is at **99.4% ShellCheck coverage** (not 80%)
2. Identifying **357 total active linter rules** (not 240)
3. Revealing **v6.2.0 is current** (not v5.0.0)
4. Maintaining **zero regressions** and **100% test pass rate**

The project is **significantly more mature** than ROADMAP.yaml indicated. This audit provides an accurate baseline for future planning and properly represents bashrs's achievement as a **near-complete ShellCheck-equivalent linter** with extensive custom safety rules.
