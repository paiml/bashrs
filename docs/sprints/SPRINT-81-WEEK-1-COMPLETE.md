   - 8 tests (all passing)

2. **MAKE008: Tab vs spaces (CRITICAL)**
   - Detects spaces instead of tabs in recipe lines (fatal Make error)
   - **Severity: ERROR** - Most common Make mistake
   - Auto-fix: Replace leading spaces with tab character
   - 8 tests (all passing)

3. **MAKE010: Missing error handling**
   - Detects critical commands (cp, mv, rm, install, chmod, chown, ln, mkdir, curl, wget, git) without error handling
   - Auto-fix: Add `|| exit 1` to ensure build stops on failure
   - 8 tests (all passing)

#### Day 2 - Safety & Correctness (2 rules, 33% total)
4. **MAKE015: Missing .DELETE_ON_ERROR**
   - Detects Makefiles without .DELETE_ON_ERROR special target
   - Prevents corrupted builds from partially-built files
   - Auto-fix: Add `.DELETE_ON_ERROR:` at top of Makefile
   - 8 tests (all passing)

5. **MAKE018: Parallel-unsafe targets**

   - Auto-fix: Replace with `$(PREFIX)` variable
   - 8 tests (all passing)

#### Day 4 - Advanced (1 rule, 53% total - WEEK 1 COMPLETE)

   - Detects recursive make invocations ($(MAKE), ${MAKE}, make -C)
   - Breaks dependency tracking and parallel builds

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical Insights

1. **MAKE008 is critical**: Tab vs spaces is the #1 Make error - highest impact rule
2. **String literal gotcha**: Raw strings `r#"..."#` don't interpret `\t` - use regular strings
3. **Parallel safety detection**: Tracking shared state writes effectively catches race conditions
4. **Recursive make detection**: Multiple patterns needed ($(MAKE), ${MAKE}, make -C, --directory)

### Process Insights

1. **EXTREME TDD works**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR strictly followed (100% adherence)
2. **8 tests per rule**: Optimal coverage without over-testing
3. **Helper extraction**: Consistent pattern of 2-3 helper functions per rule
4. **Zero regressions**: Critical for maintaining quality and user trust

### Velocity Insights

1. **Day 1 highest**: 3 rules (learning phase, high energy)
2. **Days 2-3 sustainable**: 2 rules/day (optimal pace)
3. **Day 4 buffer used**: 1 rule (Week 1 completion focus)
4. **Week 2 projection**: 1-2 rules/day (on track for 100%)
