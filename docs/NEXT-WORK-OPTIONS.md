---

## 📊 Option 1: Push for A++ Grade (Max Complexity <10)

**Goal**: Achieve A++ (Perfect) grade by refactoring remaining complexity hotspots

### Work Involved

**Refactor 4-6 Additional Files**:
1. **sc2096.rs** (complexity: 14) - Highest current offender
2. **sec002.rs** (complexity: 13)
3. **sc2153.rs** (complexity: 13)
4. **sc2117.rs** (complexity: 12)
5. **sc2037.rs** (complexity: 12)
6. **sc2128.rs** (complexity: 12)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days (following established refactoring pattern)

### Benefits
- ✅ **A++ Grade Certification**: Max complexity <10 across entire codebase
- ✅ **90+ Helper Functions**: Extremely high modularity
- ✅ **<50 hrs Refactoring Time**: 75% reduction from v6.7.0 baseline
- ✅ **Best-in-class Quality**: Among top 1% of Rust projects
- ✅ **Marketing**: "Perfect code quality" is a strong differentiator

### Risks
- ⚠️ **Diminishing Returns**: Already at A+ grade
- ⚠️ **Opportunity Cost**: Could be building new features instead
- ⚠️ **Over-engineering**: Files are already very maintainable at 12-14 complexity

### Recommendation
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**When to Choose**:
- If quality/maintainability is the top priority
- If preparing for major OSS launch or enterprise adoption
- If team values "perfect" metrics for marketing

**Effort vs Value**: 7/10 - Good, but not urgent

## 📊 Option 2: Implement Bash Quality Tools (High Value, High Impact)

**Goal**: Build comprehensive bash script quality tooling suite

### Work Involved

Based on `docs/BASH-QUALITY-TOOLS.md` design spec:

**Phase 1: Foundation** (3-5 days)
- ✅ Design spec complete
- 🔧 Implement `bashrs test` - Run tests on bash scripts
- 🔧 Implement `bashrs score` - TDG-style quality scoring
- 🔧 Create module structure (testing/, coverage/, format/, score/)

**Phase 2: Core Features** (5-7 days)
- 🔧 Implement `bashrs coverage` - Coverage tracking (kcov integration + built-in)
- 🔧 Implement `bashrs format` - Bash script formatting (shfmt integration + built-in)
- 🔧 Implement `bashrs check` - Comprehensive check command

**Phase 3: Polish** (2-3 days)
- 🔧 Documentation (README, book chapters)
- 🔧 Examples and tutorials
- 🔧 CI/CD integration guide

**Total Estimated Time**: 10-15 days

### Benefits
- ✅ **Unique Differentiator**: No other tool offers all 5 (test, lint, coverage, format, score)
- ✅ **Complete Platform**: bashrs becomes the "cargo for bash"
- ✅ **High User Value**: Solves real pain points in bash development
- ✅ **Market Positioning**: Direct competitor to ShellCheck + shfmt + bats combined
- ✅ **Revenue Potential**: Enterprise teams need quality tooling
- ✅ **Community Growth**: Attracts bash developers seeking modern tooling

### Risks
- ⚠️ **Scope Creep**: 5 new commands is a large surface area
- ⚠️ **Integration Complexity**: Needs shfmt, kcov, bats integration
- ⚠️ **Maintenance Burden**: More code to maintain long-term

### Recommendation
**Priority**: HIGH

**When to Choose**:
- If growing user base is the goal
- If differentiation from ShellCheck is important
- If building a complete bash development platform
- If targeting enterprise/professional developers

**Effort vs Value**: 9/10 - Excellent value proposition

### Implementation Strategy

**Week 1: Test + Score** (MVP)
```bash
# Minimal viable implementation
bashrs test script.sh      # Run inline tests
bashrs score script.sh     # Quality score
```

**Week 2: Coverage + Format**
```bash
bashrs coverage script.sh  # Coverage report
bashrs format script.sh    # Format script
```

**Week 3: Integration + Docs**
```bash
bashrs check script.sh     # All checks
# Documentation, examples, CI/CD guide
```

- 🔧 Streaming I/O optimization

**Phase 3: Advanced Features** (3-4 days)
- 🔧 LSP server in WASM
- 🔧 Syntax highlighting integration
