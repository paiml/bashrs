# bashrs v6.19.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 29, 2025
**Type**: Minor Release (New Features)
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Release

## 🚀 Overview

Feature release introducing powerful REPL enhancements that dramatically improve interactive bash script development. The REPL now supports automatic mode-based command processing and utility commands for better session management.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
cargo install bashrs --version 6.19.0
```

Or in `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
bashrs = "6.19.0"
```

## ✨ What's New

### 1. Automatic Mode-Based Command Processing (REPL-003-005)

**The Killer Feature**: Commands are now automatically processed based on the current mode.

**Before v6.19.0** - Repetitive prefixes required:
```bash
bashrs [purify]> :purify mkdir /tmp/test
bashrs [purify]> :purify rm /tmp/old
bashrs [purify]> :purify ln -s /tmp/new /tmp/link
```

**After v6.19.0** - Automatic processing:
```bash
bashrs [normal]> :mode purify
Switched to purify mode

bashrs [purify]> mkdir /tmp/test
✓ Purified: Purified 1 statement(s)

bashrs [purify]> rm /tmp/old
✓ Purified: Purified 1 statement(s)
```

**How it works**:
- Switch to `purify` mode → all commands automatically purified
- Switch to `lint` mode → all commands automatically linted
- Explicit commands (`:parse`, `:purify`, `:lint`) still work in any mode
- Eliminates repetitive typing and speeds up workflow

**Implementation**:
- File: `rash/src/repl/loop.rs:252-293`
- Tests: 12 comprehensive integration tests
- Test file: `rash/tests/test_repl_mode_based_processing.rs`

### 2. Utility Commands (REPL-004-001)

Three new commands for better session management:

#### `:history` - View Command History
```bash
bashrs [normal]> echo hello
bashrs [normal]> mkdir test
bashrs [normal]> :history
Command History (3 commands):
  1 echo hello
  2 mkdir test
  3 :history
```

#### `:vars` - Show Session Variables
```bash
bashrs [normal]> :vars
No session variables set

# Future: When variable assignment is implemented
bashrs [normal]> x=5
bashrs [normal]> :vars
Session Variables (1 variables):
  x = 5
```

#### `:clear` - Clear Screen
```bash
bashrs [normal]> :clear
# Screen cleared using ANSI escape codes
```

**Implementation**:
- File: `rash/src/repl/loop.rs:296-334`
- Tests: 8 comprehensive integration tests
- Test file: `rash/tests/test_repl_utility_commands.rs`

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation (REPL-004-002)

Updated Interactive REPL guide with:
- "Utility Commands" section with command reference table
- "Automatic Mode-Based Processing" section with detailed examples
- Example 5: Using Utility Commands
- Example 6: Automatic Mode Processing Workflow
- 133 new lines of user-facing documentation

**Documentation**:
- File: `book/src/getting-started/repl.md`
- Builds successfully with mdbook

## 🎯 Benefits

### Productivity Improvements
- **50% less typing**: No more `:purify`/`:lint` prefixes in mode-based workflows
- **Faster iteration**: Switch mode once, process many commands
- **Better visibility**: `:history` shows what you've done
- **Cleaner workspace**: `:clear` for fresh start

### User Experience
- **More intuitive**: Mode-based processing matches user mental model
- **Better session management**: View history and variables anytime
- **Improved help**: Updated help text shows all commands

### Quality
- **20 new integration tests** (100% pass rate)
- **EXTREME TDD**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR methodology
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Real-world examples

## 📊 Quality Metrics

- **Build**: Clean with zero errors ✅
- **Tests**: All 5,165+ tests passing (includes 20 new REPL tests) ✅
- **Coverage**: 100% coverage on new REPL features ✅
- **Documentation**: Complete user-facing docs ✅
- **Breaking Changes**: None ✅
- **Behavioral Changes**: Additive only (no regressions) ✅

## 🔧 Changes

### Added
- Automatic command processing in `purify` and `lint` modes
- `:history` command to view session command history
- `:vars` command to display session variables
- `:clear` command to clear the screen
- Updated help text with new utility commands

### Changed
- REPL workflow now more intuitive with mode-based processing
- History tracking includes all commands (not just bash code)
- Prompt context improved (shows current mode)

### Fixed
- None (no bugs fixed in this release)

## 🎯 Toyota Way Principles Applied

**自働化 (Jidoka - Built-in Quality)**:
- EXTREME TDD with RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycles
- 20 integration tests written before implementation
- 100% test pass rate maintained

**現地現物 (Genchi Genbutsu - Go and See)**:
- Verified features through comprehensive documentation
- Real-world examples demonstrate actual usage
- Interactive validation in REPL environment

**改善 (Kaizen - Continuous Improvement)**:
- Eliminated repetitive `:purify`/`:lint` prefixes
- Improved session management with utility commands
- Better user experience through mode-based processing

**ムダ (Muda - Eliminate Waste)**:
- Removed unnecessary typing (mode-based auto-processing)
- Streamlined workflow (one mode switch, many commands)
- Faster iteration (no prefix overhead)

## 📝 Migration Notes

No migration required - this is a non-breaking minor release. Simply update your version number and start using the new features:

```bash
cargo install bashrs --version 6.19.0
```

Then explore the new REPL capabilities:

```bash
$ bashrs repl
bashrs [normal]> help
# See all new commands

bashrs [normal]> :mode purify
# Try automatic purification

bashrs [purify]> mkdir /tmp/test
# Automatically purified!

bashrs [purify]> :history
# See what you've done
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

Planned for v6.20.0:
- Debug mode implementation (step-by-step execution)
- Explain mode implementation (bash syntax explanations)
- Tab completion for commands
- Variable assignment support
