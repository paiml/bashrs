audit_date: 2025-10-14
auditor: Gemini
project: bashrs
version: 1.2.1

summary: |
  The bashrs project is a promising tool for improving shell script safety.
  The codebase is generally well-structured and has a good amount of test coverage.
  However, the audit revealed two critical bugs that prevent the project from being
  used as intended. There is also a parsing error in one of the examples that
  needs to be addressed.

findings:
  - id: BUG-001
    title: Transpiler does not generate empty functions
    description: |
      The transpiler does not generate shell functions for Rust functions with
      empty bodies. This causes a "command not found" error when the generated
      shell script is executed.
    reproduction: |
      1. Create a Rust file with an empty function that is called from `main`.
      2. Transpile the file using `bashrs build`.
      3. Execute the generated shell script.
      4. The script will fail with a "command not found" error.
    recommendation: |
      The transpiler should be modified to generate empty shell functions
      (e.g., `my_func() { :; }`) for all functions defined in the Rust source,
      even if they have empty bodies.

    title: Parse error in `examples/backup-clean.rs`
    description: |
      The `test-example` make target fails with a parse error when processing
      `examples/backup-clean.rs`. The error message "expected square brackets"
      suggests that the transpiler is failing to parse some of the Rust code
      that uses square brackets. The most likely culprit is the use of the `?`
      operator, which may not be supported by the version of the Rust parser
      being used by `bashrs`.
    reproduction: |
      1. Run `make test-example`
      2. The build will fail with a parse error.
    recommendation: |
      The Rust parser used by `bashrs` should be updated to a version that
      supports the `?` operator and other modern Rust syntax. Alternatively,
      the example file could be modified to not use the `?` operator.

    title: Improve test failure reporting
    description: |
      The test suite does not provide enough information about why a test
      failed. When a test fails, the generated shell script should be printed
      to the console to make it easier to debug the issue.
    recommendation: |
      Modify the test suite to print the generated shell script to the console
      when a test fails. This can be done by adding a `println!` macro to the
      test functions that execute shell scripts.
