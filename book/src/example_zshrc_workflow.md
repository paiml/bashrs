# Complete Quality Workflow: Real-World .zshrc Analysis

This chapter demonstrates the complete bashrs quality workflow on a real-world shell configuration file, showing how to use all available quality tools to analyze, score, and improve your shell scripts.

## Overview

We'll walk through analyzing a `.zshrc` file (161 lines) using **all** bashrs quality tools:

1. **lint** - Identify code quality issues
2. **score** - Get quality grade and score
3. **audit** - Comprehensive quality check
4. **coverage** - Test coverage analysis
5. **config analyze** - Configuration-specific analysis
6. **format** - Code formatting (where supported)
7. **test** - Run embedded tests

## Initial Assessment

### File Statistics
- **Size**: 161 lines (~5KB)
- **Type**: Zsh configuration with Oh My Zsh
- **Functions**: 1 custom function (`claude-bedrock`)
- **Tests**: 0 (no tests found)

## Step 1: Quick Score Check

```bash
$ cargo run --bin bashrs -- score ~/.zshrc
```

**Result:**
```text
Bash Script Quality Score
=========================

Overall Grade: D
Overall Score: 6.1/10.0

Improvement Suggestions:
------------------------
1. Reduce function complexity by extracting nested logic
2. Break down large functions (>20 lines) into smaller functions
3. Add test functions (test_*) to verify script behavior
4. Aim for at least 50% test coverage

⚠ Below average. Multiple improvements needed.
```

**Insight**: Score of 6.1/10 (D grade) indicates significant room for improvement.

---

## Step 2: Detailed Linting

```bash
$ cargo run --bin bashrs -- lint ~/.zshrc
```

**Results:**
```text
Summary: 2 error(s), 38 warning(s), 13 info(s)

Critical Errors:
✗ Line 73: DET002 - Non-deterministic timestamp usage (UNSAFE)
✗ Line 93: DET002 - Non-deterministic timestamp usage (UNSAFE)
```

**Issues Found:**
- **2 errors**: Timestamp usage with `date +%s` (flagged as non-deterministic)
- **38 warnings**: Variable references, quoting suggestions, style issues
- **13 info**: Style consistency recommendations

**Example Issues:**
```bash
# Line 73 - Flagged as non-deterministic
start_time="$(date +%s)"

# Line 93 - Flagged as non-deterministic
end_time="$(date +%s)"

# Multiple SC2154 warnings - Variables set externally
# These are legitimate for .zshrc:
- $NVM_DIR (set by Node Version Manager)
- $BUN_INSTALL (set by Bun installer)
- Variables in function scopes
```

**Note**: The timestamp errors are **false positives** for this use case - measuring command execution time is legitimate in a shell configuration file and not security-sensitive.

---

## Step 3: Comprehensive Audit

```bash
$ cargo run --bin bashrs -- audit ~/.zshrc
```

**Results:**
```text
Comprehensive Quality Audit
===========================

File: ~/.zshrc

Check Results:
--------------
✅ Parse:    Valid bash syntax
❌ Lint:     2 errors, 38 warnings
⚠️  Test:     No tests found
✅ Score:    D (6.1/10.0)

Overall: ❌ FAIL
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **Parse**: Valid syntax - file will execute correctly
- ❌ **Lint**: Quality issues need attention
- ⚠️ **Test**: 0% coverage (no tests)
- **Score**: 6.1/10 (D grade)

---

## Step 4: Coverage Analysis

```bash
$ cargo run --bin bashrs -- coverage ~/.zshrc
```

**Results:**
```text
Coverage Report: ~/.zshrc

Lines:     0/103   (0.0%)  ❌
Functions: 0/1   (0.0%)  ❌

Uncovered Lines: 103 lines
Uncovered Functions: 1

⚠️  No tests found - 0% coverage
```

**Insight**: Configuration files typically don't have tests, but custom functions like `claude-bedrock` could benefit from testing.

---

## Step 5: Configuration-Specific Analysis

```bash
$ cargo run --bin bashrs -- config analyze ~/.zshrc
```

**Results:**
```text
Analysis: ~/.zshrc
============================

Statistics:
  - Lines: 161
  - Complexity score: 7/10
  - Config type: Zshrc

PATH Entries (3):
  ✓  Line 2: Complex FPATH manipulation
  ✓  Line 141: $BUN_INSTALL/bin
  ✓  Line 160: /usr/local/go/bin

Issues Found: 2
  ⚠ [CONFIG-004] Line 73: Non-deterministic timestamp
  ⚠ [CONFIG-004] Line 93: Non-deterministic timestamp
```

**Insight**: The config analyzer correctly identifies the file as a Zshrc and tracks PATH modifications.

---

## Step 6: Test Execution

```bash
$ cargo run --bin bashrs -- test ~/.zshrc
```

**Results:**
```text
Running tests in ~/.zshrc
⚠ No tests found in ~/.zshrc
```

**Expected**: Configuration files typically don't include tests.

---

## Step 7: Code Formatting (Best Effort)

```bash
$ cargo run --bin bashrs -- format ~/.zshrc
```

**Results:**
```text
error: Failed to format: Lexer error at line 63
```

**Note**: The formatter encountered regex patterns (`^eu-`) that are not yet fully supported. This is expected for complex shell constructs.

## Interpreting the Results

### What the Tools Tell Us

1. **score (6.1/10 D)**: Overall quality below average
   - Missing tests
   - High function complexity
   - Linting issues

2. **lint (2 errors, 38 warnings)**:
   - Timestamp usage (legitimate for timing)
   - Variable scoping (false positives for .zshrc)
   - Style improvements available

3. **audit (FAIL)**: Failed due to lint errors
   - Would pass if timestamp errors were suppressed
   - Test coverage affects score

4. **coverage (0%)**: No tests found
   - Expected for configuration files
   - Custom functions could have tests

5. **config analyze (7/10)**: Moderate complexity
   - PATH modifications tracked
   - Non-deterministic constructs flagged

### Quality Improvement Recommendations

#### High Priority
1. **Add test functions** for `claude-bedrock`:
   ```bash
   # TEST: test_claude_bedrock_region_parsing
   test_claude_bedrock_region_parsing() {
       # Test that EU regions get EU model
       [[ "$(get_model_for_region "eu-west-3")" == *"eu.anthropic"* ]] || return 1
       return 0
   }
   ```

2. **Suppress legitimate timestamp warnings** with `bashrs:ignore`:
   ```bash
   # bashrs:ignore DET002 - Timing is intentional, not security-sensitive
   start_time="$(date +%s)"
   ```

3. **Break down large functions**:
   ```bash
   # Extract region detection logic
   get_model_for_region() {
       local region="$1"
       if [[ "$region" =~ ^eu- ]]; then
           echo "eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
       elif [[ "$region" =~ ^us- ]]; then
           echo "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
       else
           echo "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
       fi
   }
   ```

#### Medium Priority
4. **Quote variable expansions** (many SC2086 warnings)
5. **Use single quotes** for literal strings (SC2311 info messages)

#### Low Priority
6. **Consider shellcheck disable comments** for false positives
7. **Document complex regex patterns** with comments

### For Shell Configuration Files (.bashrc, .zshrc)

```bash
# Quick quality check
bashrs score ~/.zshrc

# Detailed analysis (run all tools)
bashrs audit ~/.zshrc     # Comprehensive check
bashrs lint ~/.zshrc      # Detailed issues
bashrs config analyze ~/.zshrc  # Config-specific

# Optional (if you have tests)
bashrs test ~/.zshrc

```

### For Production Shell Scripts

```bash
# Complete quality workflow
bashrs audit script.sh              # Comprehensive audit
bashrs lint script.sh               # Detailed linting
bashrs test script.sh               # Run tests
bashrs coverage script.sh           # Coverage report
bashrs format script.sh --check     # Verify formatting

# Minimum quality gates
bashrs score script.sh --min-grade B  # Require B or better
bashrs audit script.sh --min-grade A  # Require A or better
```

### For CI/CD Pipelines

```bash
# Quality gate in CI
if ! bashrs audit script.sh --min-grade B; then
    echo "Quality gate failed: script below B grade"
    exit 1
fi

# Generate quality report
bashrs audit script.sh --format json > quality-report.json
```
