# .bashrsignore File Reference

The `.bashrsignore` file allows you to exclude specific files from linting, providing a proper way to handle false positives and intentional violations.

## Overview

When bashrs lints a file, it first checks for a `.bashrsignore` file in the project hierarchy. If the file matches a pattern in `.bashrsignore`, it is skipped with a message explaining which pattern matched.

This is essential for:
- **Vendor scripts**: Third-party scripts that shouldn't be modified
- **Metrics/telemetry**: Scripts that intentionally use timestamps
- **Legacy code**: Scripts with known issues being addressed separately
- **Generated files**: Auto-generated scripts that will be regenerated

## File Format

The `.bashrsignore` file uses gitignore-style syntax:

```text
# .bashrsignore

# Comments start with #
# Empty lines are ignored

# Simple filename
record-metric.sh

# Glob patterns
vendor/*.sh
**/generated/*.sh

# Directory patterns
scripts/legacy/**

# Negation (re-include previously excluded)
!vendor/important.sh
```

## Syntax Reference

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `file.sh` | Exact filename | Matches `file.sh` |
| `*.sh` | Wildcard | Matches any `.sh` file |
| `**/*.sh` | Recursive wildcard | Matches `.sh` files in any directory |
| `dir/*` | Directory contents | Matches files in `dir/` |
| `!pattern` | Negation | Re-includes previously excluded files |
| `# comment` | Comment | Ignored by parser |

## CLI Flags

### `--no-ignore`

Disable `.bashrsignore` processing and lint all files:

```bash
# Lint even if file is in .bashrsignore
bashrs lint scripts/record-metric.sh --no-ignore
```

### `--ignore-file <FILE>`

Use a custom ignore file instead of `.bashrsignore`:

```bash
# Use project-specific ignore file
bashrs lint script.sh --ignore-file .lint-ignore

# Use absolute path
bashrs lint script.sh --ignore-file /etc/bashrs/global-ignore
```

## File Discovery

bashrs searches for `.bashrsignore` in the following order:

1. Custom path (if `--ignore-file` specified)
2. Same directory as the input file
3. Parent directories (walking up to root)
4. Current working directory

This allows project-level and repository-level ignore files.

## Example: Metrics Recording Script

A common use case is excluding metrics recording scripts that intentionally use timestamps:

```text
# .bashrsignore

# Metrics recording script from paiml-mcp-agent-toolkit
# Rationale: DET002 (timestamps) and SEC010 (paths) are false positives
# The script intentionally uses timestamps - that's its PURPOSE
scripts/record-metric.sh
```

## Example: Vendor Directory

Exclude entire vendor directories while keeping specific important files:

```text
# .bashrsignore

# Exclude all vendor scripts
vendor/**/*.sh

# But keep our customized installer
!vendor/custom-installer.sh
```

## Example: Generated Files

Exclude auto-generated files that will be regenerated:

```text
# .bashrsignore

# Generated by build process - will be regenerated
build/generated/**/*.sh
dist/**/*.sh

# Test fixtures (intentionally contain violations)
tests/fixtures/bad-*.sh
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Document Rationale

Always include comments explaining WHY a file is excluded:

```text
# .bashrsignore

# BAD: No explanation
scripts/deploy.sh

# GOOD: Clear rationale
# Legacy deployment script - DET002/SEC010 false positives
# Tracked in Issue #123 for proper refactoring
scripts/deploy.sh
```

### 2. Be Specific

Prefer specific patterns over broad ones:

```text
# BAD: Too broad
*.sh

# GOOD: Specific exclusions
vendor/legacy/*.sh
scripts/record-metric.sh
```

### 3. Version Control

Always commit `.bashrsignore` to version control for audit trail:

```bash
git add .bashrsignore
git commit -m "Add .bashrsignore for metrics scripts (Issue #58)"
```

### 4. Review Periodically

Review `.bashrsignore` regularly to ensure exclusions are still needed:

```bash
# List all ignored files
cat .bashrsignore | grep -v '^#' | grep -v '^$'
```

## Comparison with Inline Suppression

| Feature | .bashrsignore | Inline Suppression |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Scope | Entire file | Single line/file |
| Syntax | Glob patterns | `# bashrs disable-*` |
| Use case | Vendor files, false positives | Intentional violations |
| Visibility | Centralized | In-file |

Use `.bashrsignore` when:
- The entire file should be excluded
- You cannot modify the file (vendor)
- Multiple rules are violated

Use inline suppression when:
- Only specific lines need suppression
- You want documentation in-place
- The file is under your control

## Integration with CI/CD

### Pre-commit Hook

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: bashrs-lint
        name: bashrs lint
        entry: bashrs lint
        language: system
        files: \\.sh$
        # .bashrsignore is automatically respected
```

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
# .github/workflows/lint.yml
- name: Lint shell scripts
  run: |
    # .bashrsignore is automatically respected
    find . -name "*.sh" -exec bashrs lint {} \;
```

## Troubleshooting

### File not being ignored

1. Check pattern syntax:
   ```bash
   # Verify pattern
   cat .bashrsignore | grep "your-file"
   ```

2. Check file location relative to `.bashrsignore`:
   ```bash
   # .bashrsignore patterns are relative to its location
   ls -la .bashrsignore
   ```

3. Use `--no-ignore` to verify the file has violations:
   ```bash
   bashrs lint file.sh --no-ignore
   ```

### Pattern not matching

Test patterns with the glob crate's behavior:

```bash
# Exact match
scripts/record-metric.sh

# NOT: scripts/*/record-metric.sh (unless ** is used)
**/record-metric.sh
```
