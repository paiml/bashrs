# RASH v0.1.0 Release Notes

## üöÄ Major Release: Production-Grade Rust-to-Shell Transpiler

This release establishes RASH as a production-ready Rust-to-Shell transpiler with enterprise-grade build infrastructure, comprehensive testing, and formal verification capabilities.

### ‚ú® Key Features

#### Build System & CI/CD
- **Comprehensive Makefile**: Complete build orchestration with targets for:
  - `make lint` - Run linting with automatic fixes
  - `make test` - Run comprehensive tests with coverage reporting
  - `make release` - Prepare release builds
  - `make validate` - Full validation pipeline including quality gates
  - `make verify` - Formal verification with Kani, Creusot, and SMT solvers
  - `make fuzz` - Fuzzing infrastructure for all components

#### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **Main CI/CD Pipeline** (`main.yml`):
  - Multi-stage validation with parallel quality checks
  - Cross-platform build matrix (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Automatic release creation on main branch push
  
- **Comprehensive Test Pipeline** (`test-pipeline.yml`):
  - Unit, integration, property-based, and fuzz testing
  - Cross-shell compatibility testing (bash, dash, ash, ksh, zsh, busybox)
  - Coverage reporting with 85% threshold enforcement

- **Automated Release Workflow** (`release.yml`):
  - Semantic versioning with patch/minor/major options
  - Automatic changelog generation
  - Multi-platform binary builds
  - crates.io publishing support

- **Quality Monitoring** (`quality-monitor.yml`):
  - Daily quality trend analysis
  - Automated quality dashboard generation
  - Alert system for quality degradation

#### Quality Engineering
- **Verification Infrastructure**:
  - Kani bounded model checking for safety properties
  - Injection safety verification
  - Deterministic transpilation verification
  - Property-based testing framework

- **Quality Analysis Tools**:
  - Integration with PAIML MCP Agent Toolkit for complexity analysis
  - Custom quality gate binaries
  - Metrics collection and reporting
  - DO-178C compliance framework

#### Testing Enhancements
- **Cross-Shell Validation**: Automated testing across 6 different POSIX shells
- **Determinism Verification**: Script ensures identical output across multiple runs
- **Coverage Enforcement**: Automated coverage checking with configurable thresholds
- **Fuzzing Support**: Cargo-fuzz integration for finding edge cases
